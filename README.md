# SnakeAndLadder
We all have played the game of Snake and Ladder. 
This program is just a basic version of that game. 
I have written this program in C language.

# GettingStarted
For executing this program, only a C compiler is required.
Just copy the Code, paste it in your compiler, compile it and run.

# More
Only two players can play this game at a time. This game contains one snake and one ladder.
After each iteration the position of players will be displayed on the board.
This game can be played as Player vs player or Computer vs Computer or Player vs Computer.
Initially I have set it as Player vs Computer. For changing it to any other method just comment the statements of manual input methods 
and uncomment the statements of random input methods and vice versa.
